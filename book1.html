            <h2>Introduction to Time Block </h2>
            <span>You might be agree with this this fact that most people we see are with lack of energy and enthusiasm. Believe me it is true you need 
                just little mental strength to be apart from them.
                
                 Time blocking is a very results-oriented way of viewing and using time. it's  a way of making sure that was has  to be done
                gets done. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus. Time blocking harness your energy and center it on  your most important work .
                
                so, go and get a calendar and block off all the time you need to accomplish your ONE thing. If it's a regularly thing, block
                off the appropriate time every day, so its become your habit.</span>

            <h2>#1 BLOCK YOUR TIME OFF</h2>
            <span>Extraordinary successful people launch their year by taking time out to plan their time off. Why? Because they know they'll need it and they can
                afford it. In truth,successful people simply see themself working in their vacations. On the other hand least successful people don't plan their
                time off because they think that they don't deserve it or not be able to afford it.
                
                By planning your time off or time to relax you are making clear in your mind which time is dedicated for your work and which time is for
                your rest. As a result you are more effective in your working time. 
                
                By planning your time off in advance you're also letting everyone in advance that when you will be free and they can plan accordingly.
                Remember resting is as important as working.</span>

            <h2>#2 TIME BLOCK YOUR ONE THING</h2>
            <span>After you have blocked your time off, now it's time to block your time for your most important task.Yes, You read that right your most 
                important thing come second.Because you can't sustain a happy success life if you neglect your personal life.
                
                The most productive people, the one who experience extraordinary result, design their day around their one thing i.e their most important task.
                Their most important appointment each day with themself and the never miss it.
                
                The key to making this result is to block time as early as possible.Give yourself 30min or hour to plan out your day.
                My recommendation is to block 4 hours a day. This is'nt a typo.Honestly if you want to make your life better you will have to work harder and smarter.
                
                
                Be maker in the morning and manager in the afternoon. Yes, this is harsh true of this world that everything will not go according to plan.
                So, manage whenever neccessary and this make us move to our next point "PROTECT YOUR TIME BLOCK"

            <h2>#3 PROTECT YOUR TIME BLOCK</h2>
            <span>The world doest'nt know your purpose or priority and isn't responsible for them - you are. So, it your job to protect your time blocks fro all
                those who who don't know what matter most to you and from yourself when you forget.
                The best way to protect your time blocks is to adopt the mindset that they can't be moved. So when someone try to double book you 
                "I am sory I already have an appointment with this time and offer them your time off time i.e the time time in which you will be free or let them go."
                
                
                Unfortunately, your ressolve won't keep the world to keep from trying, so be creative whenever you can be .
                But life isn't so simple other stuff screaming to be done.So whenever such stuff pop on your head write it down on a paper.
                In case for some grave reason you fail to protect your time immediatly block a another time and manage.
